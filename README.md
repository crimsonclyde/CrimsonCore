### Project Discription:
CrimsonCore is the central planet in the CrimsonUniverse. Based on a Particle Core (https://particle.io) it controls a relay to active a led light to illuminate a stone circle. To do so it measures the brightness with a photo resistor and by a given value it switches the relay on. CrimsonCore measures the temperature and store the values in the cloud. An OLED display is attached to the Core and displays the time, temperature and the status of the relay.
The project is dedicated to a game, back in the days, that I am absolutly adore. Maniac Mansion from 1987. Therefore the version names are based on characters from the game. DonÂ´t be scared there is more freakiness out there.


- [x] beta 1 = Jeff Woodie        "Surfer Dude"
- [x] beta 2 = Sandy Pantz        "Stereotypical blonde cheerleader"
- [x] beta 3 = Ted                "Dead cousin"
- [x] beta 4 = Dr. Fred Edision   "Mad scientist"
- [x] beta 5 = Razor              "Punk Girl"
- [x] beta 6 = Syd                "Guy who put the hamster in the microwave"
- [x] beta 7 = Michael F. Stoppe  "Award winning photographer"
- [ ] beta 8 = t.b.a.


### So, whats that heck is that all about?
Fun. Learning. Brainfood. As I started I simply want to attach a LED to an Arduino Nano. Days go by and I found myself knee-deep into hooking up more components and sensors and a relay to control a 230V light. I learned quite a lot these days and after a while I build a bit of an home automation system. Starting with an Arduino Nano I switched to an Particle Core as base micro controller.


### Roadmap

##### Beta 5 "Razor"
Razor is a punk girl. The lead-singer of the band "Razor and the Scummetts" This is punk because it is completely rewritten. Due to the Architecture change from Arduino (Atmel ATMega328) to Spark Core (STM32F103CB - ARM 32-bit Cortex M3). Not all what I have done with the Arduino runs exactly on the Spark Core. Example: I do not need a RTC Module anymore, because I am connected to Wifi and therefore I can use time syncronisation (just like NTP). Beta 5 should be the proof-of-concept if everything works and then I can impliment new features like webaccess.

##### Beta 6 "Syd"
The only one who accepts to put the hamster in the microwave. So we have nearly all done. Things will work. Only a few of them not. OLED Display runs a button to turn it off or on is installed. The OLED-Icons are upgreaded. The function to save energy is installed know as deep-sleep-mode. CrimsonCTRL works now pretty smoth. Some recode needed to get it to HTML5 with change the Mobile/Web view only over the stylesheet. The buttons did not work for switching the StoneCircleLight directly over the webinterface.

##### Beta 7 "Michael F. Stoppe"
Introducing the first half-backed-nearly-ready codebase and the web buttons works now. We can
switch the Stone-Circle-Light on/off over our HTML5 page. A bunch of bugfixes and workarounds. E.g. there was a problem when the Core has no internet/cloud connection in this case no code is executed. The Core tries over and over again to get the connection back on, in this time no code is executed. The GPIO pin used for the Stone-Circle-Light is set to LOW which means the relay is closed and therefore the light is on. This is bad because if we are not at home and the internet is down we waste power for nothing. With late beta 6 and now stable in beta 7 we switched to Semi-Automated mode. If this is set, the Core first execute the code. Setup() runs pin is set to HIGH, light is off we get into the loop() and now we can connect on our on purpose.


### Conclusion:
Who knows, maybe someday I find the fuel for the chainsaw in another game.
